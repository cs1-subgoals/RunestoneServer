        <p>Problem: Write a loop that will add up 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + &#8230; + 1/1024</p>

            <title>SG1:  Determine purpose of loop</title>
            <p>Because we know the number of iterations, we <em>could</em> choose a for-loop, but for this exercise we will go with the general purpose while-loop.</p>

            <title>SG2: Define and initialize variables</title>
            <program language="java"><input>
double sum = 0;
double term = 1.0;
while (        )
{

}
System.out.println(sum);
</input></program>

            <title>SG3: Define termination condition invert to continuation condition</title>
            <p>
                The denominators are increasing powers of 2. The first denominator, if you think of 1 as 1/1, is 2 raised to the power of 0. 
                The final denominator, 1024, is 2 raised to the power of 10, so we will iterate from zero to ten. 
                We know we need to iterate 10 times, from the variable i starting a 0 and it should end when i is 11.
                To convert (i >= 11) to a termination condition, it becomes (i &lt;= 10) so the code is: 
            </p> 
            
            <program language="java"><input>
double sum = 0;
double term = 1.0;
int i = 0;
while ( i &lt;= 10 )
{

}
System.out.println(sum);
</input></program>
        </subsection>
        <subsection>
            <title>SG4: Write loop body</title>
            <program language="java"><input>
double sum = 0;
double term = 1.0;
int i = 0;

while ( i &lt;= 10 )
{
   sum = sum + term;
   term = 0.5 * term; //same as divide term in half
   i++;
}
System.out.println(sum);
</input></program>
<p>
    Here is the equivalent for loop approach to solve this problem: 
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    double sum = 0;
    double term = 1.0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
        sum =  sum + term;
        term = 0.5 * term;
    }
    System.out.println(sum);
    
</input></program>
