  "title": "Worked Example: Declaration and Initialization",
  "body": " Worked Example: Declaration and Initialization   Subgoals for evaluating an assignment statement    Determine resultant data type of expression    Update variable for pre operators based on side effect    Solve arithmetic equation, operator precedence    Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.    Update variable for post operators based on side effect      You can watch this video or read through the content below it.   Evaluate these statements. If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what are the values of the variables?  int alpha, beta, gamma; double omega, theta, lambda; alpha = 42; beta = 1; omega = 2.5; theta = 4; gamma = 0.0;    SG1: Determine resultant data type of expression    The code block can be broken into 2 kinds of statements. The first two lines are the declaration statements, followed by additional assignments.    int alpha, beta, gamma; double omega, theta, lambda;    In the first line, alpha, beta, and gamma are all declared as int type variables.    Similarly, in the second line, omega, theta, and lambda are declared as double type variables.    Integers are whole numbers and doubles contain a decimal point and may contain fractional values.    alpha = 42; beta = 1; omega = 2.5; theta = 4; gamma = 0.0;    alpha = 42; the value on the RHS of the assignment statement is 42 which is a literal integer (whole number) value.    beta = 1; the value on the RHS of the assignment statement is 1 which is a literal integer (whole number) value.    omega = 2.5; the value on the RHS of the assignment statement is 2.5 which is a literal double (fractional number) value.    theta = 4; the value on the RHS of the assignment statement is 4 which is a literal integer (whole number) value.    gamma = 0.0; the value on the RHS of the assignment statement is 0.0 which is a literal double (fractional number) value.    What about lambda? What is it’s value? Because there is no assignment to the variable, its content is considered “unknown” or “garbage,” and it must be assigned before you could use lambda in another expression. In the Java specification, certain values like array contents, class variables, and instance variables are given default values like 0 or 0.0, but in our example, lambda and the others are all local variables which must be given values before their use. Some compilers, for simplicity, will give local variables the same default initializations, but it would be unwise to rely on this behavior that does not match the Java specification.      SG2: Update variable for pre-increment or pre-decrement operators based on side effect  NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE    SG3: Evaluate arithmetic expression according to operator precedence  NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE    SG4: Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.    alpha = 42; alpha has been declared as an integer and the data type of the expression on the RHS is an integer, so the value 42 can be copied into the alpha variable (the statement is valid). alpha now has the value 42.    beta = 1; beta has been declared as an integer and the data type of the expression on the RHS is an integer, so the value 1 can be copied into the beta variable (the statement is valid). beta now has the value 1.    omega = 2.5; omega has been declared as a double and the data type of the expression on the RHS is a double, so the value 2.5 can be copied into the omega variable (the statement is valid). omega now has the value 2.5.    theta = 4; theta has been declared as a double and the data type of the expression on the RHS is an integer. We can convert an integer into a decimal by simply adding “.0” to the value. The numeric value of any integer is not changed when converted to a decimal. The process of the computer adding the .0 to an int to convert it into a double is known as promotion, and is done automatically. This statement is valid. theta now has the value 4.0.    gamma = 0.0; gamma has been declared as an int and the data type of the expression on the RHS is a double. A double cannot be assigned to an integer variable and there is no automatic process to convert it. This results in a compilation error (incompatible types). If you copy the original code block into the runnable ActiveCode box, you can see the exact compilation error.    What about lambda? What is its value? Because there is no assignment to the variable, its content is considered “unknown” or “garbage,” and it must be assigned before you could use lambda in another expression. In the Java specification, certain values like array contents, class variables, and instance variables are given default values like 0 or 0.0, but in our example, lambda and the others are all local variables which must be given values before their use. Some compilers, for simplicity, will give local variables the same default initializations, but it would be unwise to rely on this behavior that does not match the Java specification.      SG5: Update variable for post-increment or post-decrement operators based on side effect  NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE   Answer: alpha is 42, beta is 1, omega is 2.5, theta is 4.0, lambda is unknown; Since we cannot assign a double to the int variable gamma, we have a compilation error on the final line.     Practice Pages  Look at this code:  int delta; \/\/declaration delta = 15; \/\/initialization int epsilon = 26; \/\/both declaration and initialization     The first line declares an integer variable (delta). The second line then copies the literal value 15 (an integer) to the variable delta. The first assignment to a variable is known as initialization.    These two lines (declaration and initialization) can be combined into a single statement, as seen on the third line involving epsilon.    This is true for any data type, not just integers. All the normal rules of assignment apply to the initialization step.              "

A simple example is gamma += 1; , which is shorthand for gamma = gamma + 1;    In the code given above, the RHS expression is delta \/ alpha + beta % alpha . This means that the value gamma + delta \/ alpha + beta % alpha will be assigned to gamma .

Division and modulus both have higher precedence than addition, so we evaluate them first, resulting in a new expression of 5 + 3 + 1 .    In the division operation, both variables are of type int , so the result is also an int value. Any fractional piece of the quotient is truncated (thrown away). As an example, 5 \/ 3 yields the value 1 .    Also remember, the mod % operation returns the remainder after integer division.    Finally, we evaluate the additions left-to-right, 5+3 is 8, and 8+1 is 9.      SG4: Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.  The LHS of the assignment is a variable of type int , and the expression result is type int .

Given the following code snippet, evaluate the final statement (the last line). If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable? Note any possible side effects.  int alpha = 2; int beta = 1; int delta = 3; int eta; int gamma; eta = beta + delta % ++alpha;    SG1 : Determine resultant data type of expression  The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement: beta + delta % ++alpha . At the beginning of the snippet, all of these variables were declared as int type, so all of the operations will also result in int values.    SG2: Update variables for any pre-increment or pre-decrement operators (side effects)  The ++ and -- syntax indicates pre- or post- side effect assignments upon variables within an expression. The expression a + 1 does not alter the value of the variable a , however a++ adds 1 to the value of 1 resulting in a new value of a .  An increment is an increase of 1, while a decrement is a decrease of 1. Generally, we only want to perform these operations on int values, but it is valid to perform them on double values.  It is important to note that the statement ++delta; would be a valid line of Java code all on its own, adding 1 to the value of delta and assigning back into the delta variable.  In this example, ++alpha is a pre-increment operation, so we increment alpha, and the new assigned value of alpha is 3 (it was initialized to 2).    SG3: Evaluate arithmetic expression according to operator precedence    The RHS may be easiest to conceptualize algebraically, by replacing the variables right away with their current values : 1 + 3 % 3 . (Remember, alpha had a pre-increment, so it is already 1 more than it was initialized.)    In the order of operations, modulus has higher precedence than addition, so we evaluate the mod first: 3 % 3 is 0. (Remember, the mod % operation returns the remainder after integer division.)    Finally, we evaluate the addition: 1 + 0 is 1.      SG4: Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.  The LHS is a variable of type int , and the RHS is type int . This is valid.    SG5: Update variable for post-increment or post-decrement operators (side effect)  It is wise to double-check whether the ++ or -- were on the left or right of the variables, to be sure whether we perform a pre or post side effect assignment. In this case, the only increment was a pre-increment , so we do not need to peform any post side effect assignments.    Questions to check and extend understanding  Q1) What are the final values of alpha , beta , delta and eta ?  Q2) The following is run: eta = beta + delta % --alpha; . What is the resulting value of eta?   Q1-Answer) alpha is 3; beta is 1; delta is 3; eta is 1;  Q2-Answer) 2     Practice Pages        "

  "body": " Worked Example: Prefix and Postfix Operators   Subgoals for evaluating an assignment statement    Determine resultant data type of expression    Update variable for pre operators based on side effect    Solve arithmetic equation, operator precedence    Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.    Update variable for post operators based on side effect      You can watch this video or read through the content below it.   Given the following code snippet, evaluate the final statement (the last line). If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable? Note any possible side effects.  int alpha = 2; int beta = 1; int delta = 3; int eta; int gamma; double omega = 2.5; double theta = -1.3; double kappa = 3.0; double lambda; double rho; lambda = ++beta \/ delta-- * alpha;    SG1 : Determine resultant data type of expression  The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement: ++beta \/ delta-- * alpha . At the beginning of the snippet, all of these variables were declared as int type, so all of the operations will also result in int values.    SG2: Update variables for any pre-increment or pre-decrement operators (side effects)  In this example, we see one pre-increment with ++beta so we increment beta before we evalute the rest of the expression. The initial value of beta was 1, so a side-effect of this statement is to assign beta the new incremented value of 2.    SG3: Evaluate arithmetic expression according to operator precedence    The RHS may be easiest to conceptualize algebraically, by replacing the variables right away with their current values : 2 \/ 3 * 2 . (Remember, beta had a pre-increment so its value has already been increased by 1. Note that the access to the variable delta is its original value.)    In the order of operations, division and multiplication have the same precedence , so we evaluate them left to right. First, 2\/3 is 0 (Remember, integer division truncates the quotient by discarding any fractional value). Thus the arithmetic expression is 0 * 2 which is a value of 0.      SG4: Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.  The LHS is a variable of type double , and the RHS is type int . This is valid, as the result of the expression will be promoted to a double.    SG5: Update variable for post-increment or post-decrement operators (side effect)  In this example we see one post-decrement with delta—so we decrement delta after we evaluate the rest of the expression. The initial value of delta was 3, so a side-effect of this statement is to assign the value 2 to delta.    Questions to check and extend understanding  Q1) What are the final values of alpha , beta , delta and lambda ?  Q2) int x = 5; int y = x--; int z = ++x; Do y and z have the same value? Why or why not?   Q1-Answer) alpha is 2; beta is 2; delta is 2; lambda is 0.0;  Q2-Answer) They are the same. y is initialized before the -- operator is applied to x, so it is set to 5 before x is set to 4. z is initialized after the ++ operator is applied, so it is set to x after x is set to 5.

Update variable for post operators based on side effect      You can watch this video or read through the content below it.   Given the following code snippet, evaluate the final statement (the last line). If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable? Note any possible side effects.  int alpha = 42; int beta = 1; int gamma = 5; boolean result; result = beta <= alpha;    SG1 : Determine resultant data type of expression  The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of the statement: beta <= alpha . The operator is one of the boolean relational operators, so the result will be boolean .  The statement above would be an acceptable, complete response for this subgoal. However, for the sake of thoroughness, here is some more information about working with different data types and boolean operators.  The relational operators are:    <= Less than or equal (i.e. “at most”)    >= Greater than or equal (i.e. “at least”)    < Strictly less than    > Strictly greater than    == Equal    != Not equal    There are a few important details to note about using these operators.    They all work as you might expect for int values. The bulk of your first lessons in boolean operators will involve only integer values.    Be careful with equality for float or double values. Because of how these values are stored in memory, computed values may be slighty different than expected, and it is a good practice to use a range of acceptable values for comparing equality. This behavior of floating-point values, as well as the methods to program against it, is a bit beyond the scope of this lesson. If you run into this problem try searching for “comparing doubles in java” on the web.    Using equality operators == or != on objects (such as Strings) only compares the memory reference; that is, two objects are only “equal” according to this operator if they are in fact the same object. If you wish to compare the values of object properties, the class definition must implement the .equals() method.    Often, the notion of an object being “less than” or “greater than” another is nonsensical. However, sometimes we do wish to sort or rank objects by one of their properties (e.g. Car objects by their price property). In such cases, Java provides the Comparable and Comparator interfaces, but those are quite beyond the scope of this lesson.      SG2: Update variables for any pre-increment or pre-decrement operators (side effects)  NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE    SG3: Evaluate arithmetic expression according to operator precedence  The RHS may be easiest to conceptualize as an algebraic inequality, by replacing the variables right away with their current values : 1 <= 42 . Logically, this is a true statement, so the returned value is boolean true .    SG4: Is the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the assignment statement a variable? Check the data type of the value on right hand side (RHS) against data type of LHS variable.  The LHS is a variable of type boolean , and the RHS is type boolean . This is valid.  If you have experience in other programming languages, you may have seen boolean true and false values interchanged with 1 and 0 integer values, or even compared with non-numeric values in a logical expression. This is NOT the case in Java. In Java, true and false are the only values that may be stored in a variable declared as a boolean .  Be careful not to confuse the meanings of false, null, 0, empty, and undefined. All these have specific meanings in programming and in Java.

The logical operators in Java are:   && - AND, if both operands are true the result is true, otherwise the result is false.  || - OR, if both operands are false the result is false, otherwise the result is true.  ! - NOT, the opposite logical value (For example, !true is false).   In the final statement, the <= operator is valid to compare primitive types, and produces boolean results, which are then used with the ! and && operators to produce one final boolean.  (You may wish to keep a precedence and associativity reference handy, until you have memorized the order of operations for boolean operators. In this example the relational operators are evaluated before the logical operators and the ! is evaluated before the && .)

Despite beta, delta, and alpha all being defined as int variables, we must check the API documentation for Math.pow to see what it returns.     In this official documentation, directly from Oracle, the left-hand column includes the return type, specified here as double .  Since beta is an int , it will be promoted when it is added to the double value returned by Math.pow, and the final result is a double value.    SG2: Update variables for any pre-increment or pre-decrement operators (side effects)  NOT USED IN THIS EXAMPLE    SG3: Evaluate arithmetic expression according to operator precedence  To determine the result of the addition operator, we must first figure out the value returned from the method call to Math.pow().  So, we start with Math.pow(3, 2) , and we must again check the documentation to be sure we know which argument is which. The API doc says, “Returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.” Thus, we use base 3 to the power of 2, which is 9. Since the API doc indicates a return type double , we should think of this value as 9.0.  Then we can add beta, so 1 + 9.0 gives us the final return value 10.0    SG4: If an assignment statement (=), is Left Hand Side (LHS) a variable? Check data type of value against data type of variable.  The LHS is a variable of type double , and the RHS is type double . This is valid.  If we had tried to assign the value of the RHS to an int variable, believing that all of the int operands would give us an int result, we would have had a compilation error for incompatible types. Ensuring compatible types is a common reason to check the API documentation for return types.

We have calculated the approximate total for what we want to order, which comes to the amount $126.50. However, we need to remember to add on an additional 20% for the tip. If the total cost of the bill is no greater than $150, then the restaurant is considered affordable. >    SG1: Determine expression that will yield variable  The expression is the right-hand-side (RHS) of an assignment statement, and for this problem we want the expression to determine whether or not the restaurant cost is affordable. To determine this we will need to mathematically calculate the total cost of the bill with the tip and then determine if it is no greater than the limit provided ($150).    SG2: Determine data type and name of variable and data type of expression  We are given the name of the variable, isAffordable . In this example, the result of the problem is to determine whether or not a particular restaurant is affordable or not – which is a yes or no (or true or false) answer. Therefore, the data type of isAffordable must be boolean.  boolean isAffordable = \/* expression goes here *\/;    SG3: Determine arithmetic equation with operators  To calculate the total cost of the restaurant bill, we need to add the estimated cost to the tip amount. To calculate the tip amount, we need to multiply the estimated cost by 20%. There are a couple of different ways to calculate this:  126.50 + 126.50 * 0.2 \/\/ adds the cost to 20% of the cost, which is the tip  Or...  126.50 * 1.2 \/\/ calculates the cost plus 20%  Note that there is usually more than one way to calculate something. You should choose the way which you understand. Generally doing fewer operations is more efficient, but understanding is more important than efficiency when learning.  Also notice that there are no $ or % symbols in the expressions. These are mathematical symbols that help the human reader understand the numbers, but Java does not need them. (In fact, it will cause errors if you include them in Java expressions. % has its own meaning in Java - as a modulus operator!)  So now we have the part of the RHS of the assignment expression that calculates the total bill:  boolean isAffordable = 126.50 * 1.2 \/* rest of expression *\/;    SG4: Determine expression components  We are now to the second part of the problem - determining if the total cost of the restaurant bill is affordable. The problem states that if the total cost of the bill is no greater than $150, then the restaurant is considered affordable.  We need to do a relational comparison of the total bill to the value $150:  boolean isAffordable = (126.50 * 1.2) < 150;  Again note that there is no $ in the expression. We have added ( ) around the calculation for the restaurant bill cost to make it clear that it is a calculation whose result is to be compared. While the ( ) are not needed for precedence (Java would automatically do the * before the <) it helps to remind us that we were calculating something to be compared. If we had chosen the other mathematical expression for calculation, the ( ) are more helpful in clarifying the value to be calculated and compared:  boolean isAffordable = (126.50 + 126.50 * 0.2) < 150;    SG5: Operators and operands must be compatible  Our final check is to make sure that the operators and operands are compatible. In our original solution we have two operators, * and < . For the multiplication, both operands are doubles so the result would be a double. For the < operator, the left operand (cost calculation) is a double and the right operand is an integer (150 is a whole number). We can compare a double to an integer using a relational operator and the result will be a boolean value. The result of the < comparison is a boolean, which can be assigned to a boolean variable ( isAffordable ). So all operations are legal.   boolean isAffordable = (126.50 * 1.2) < 150;     Practice Pages        "

Calculate and store the cost to ship a package at ShippersRUs that needs to go all the way across the country and must arrive within 2 days. There is a flat fee for all shipping that is $20.00. If the package is going to a different state, there is an additional $10 charge. If the package must arrive within a specified number of days, there is an additional charge based on the number of days. If it is an overnight shipment, add $49.95. For each additional day that it takes for delivery you can subtract $4.25. Store the total cost in a variable named cost .     Correct. The total cost calculation involves double variables, so cost must be declared as a double. The amount is 20 (flat fee) plus 10 (another state) plus the overnight fee minus 1 day (49.95 – 4.25).    Incorrect. The total cost calculation involves double variables, so cost must be declared as a double.

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);     SG1: Classify method as static method or instance method  First we need to determine what method we need to call. In looking at the documentation for the Scanner class, we see the nextDouble() method which will read in a double value. Note that there is no keyword static in the documentation for this method, so we can assume that it is an instance method. Because we want to call an instance method, we need to identify the instance which will call the method. In this example we have already created a Scanner instance which is named input .       SG2: Write (instance \/ class) dot method name and ( )  Here is the method call with the instance:   input.nextDouble()     SG3: Determine whether parameter(s) are appropriate  No parameters required (look at the API again to verify this). When you are just learning to program, you won't know any of these APIs and may have to look things up frequently. As you progress you will find that you will automatically begin to memorize the most frequently used methods, however, it is never inappropriate to look things up to be verified.    SG4: Determine what the method will return and where it will be stored  According to the API documentation, the nextDouble method returns a double. Our code can choose to store the returned double value or ignore it, in which case the value will be lost. For this example we are asked to store the value read in from the user to a variable named value . Because we do not yet have a double variable declared, we need to declare that variable. The final code looks like:   double value = input.nextDouble();     SG5: Evaluate right hand side (RHS) of assignment. Value is dependent on method’s purpose  The nextDouble method reads the next value from the input stream and attempts to convert it into a decimal value and returns a double. So the RHS is a double and the LHS is a double variable, so the assignment statement is valid.   double value = input.nextDouble();    public class main{ import java.util.Scanner; public static void main(String args[]){ } }     Practice Pages        "

Value is dependent on method’s purpose      Problem Statement  Write the Java code to calculate and store the area of a circle, where the radius is an input from the user.    You can reference section 3.8 to remind yourself how to declare and instantiate a Scanner object to read input from the user. Here is what the code should look like:  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Please enter the radius\"); \/\/ prompt the user for input double radius = input.nextDouble();    SG1: Classify method as static method or instance method  First, we need to determine what method we need to call.     The formula for calculating the area of a circle is π*radius 2 . Looking at the documentation for the Math class, we see the pow() method which will raise a number to a power. You can also see the keyword static in the documentation for this method, so the method is a static method.  Because we are calling a static method, we do not need an instance. We will call the method using the class name (Math).  If want to call an instance method, we need to identify the instance which will call the method. In this example we have already created a Scanner instance which is named input .    Write (instance \/ class) dot method name and ( )  Here is the method call:  Math.pow( );    Determine whether parameter(s) are appropriate  In the documentation, we see that two parameters are required. The first argument is the base and the second argument is the exponent. In our problem, we want to square the value of the radius. So the first argument will be the radius variable and the second will be the value 2.  Let's look at the data types of the parameters - both are of type double . Our radius variable was declared of type double , so that value is compatible as the declared parameter data type. The value 2 is an integer , but is compatible with the data type double , as an integer value can be assigned to a double variable. (Remember, you can look back to the assignment subgoals to determine the validity of this assignment.)  So the code for this method call looks like:  Math.pow(radius, 2);    Determine what the method will return and where it will be stored  According to the API documentation, the pow method returns a double , so we need a double type variable to store the value.  double result = [value of Pi] * Math.pow(radius, 2);  Some common constant values are defined in the Java language and Pi is one of these. It happens to be declared in the Math class:     To reference this value, you access the value in the same manner we do the methods, by using the class name:  Math.PI;    Evaluate right hand side (RHS) of assignment. Value is dependent on method’s purpose  In the solution for this example, both the pow method and Math.PI return double values. A double multiplied by a double is a double which is then assigned to our declared double variable result.  Here's the complete solution to the problem:  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(\"Please enter the radius\"); \/\/ prompt the user for input double radius = input.nextDouble(); double result = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);  Note that using members of the Math class does not require an import statement as that class is already included with any Java program.    import java.util.Scanner; public class main{ public static void main(String args[]){ } }    Practice Pages        "

Problem: Write the Java selection statements to solve the following specifications:   If integer variable currentNumber is odd, change its value so that it is now 4 times currentNumber plus 1; otherwise change its value so that it is now half of currentNumber (rounded down when currentNumber is odd).     SG1: Define how many mutually exclusive paths are needed  In this case, the problem says to do one action if variable is odd, and a different action otherwise.  The value in an integer variable can only be odd or even, so there are 2 mutually exclusive paths. An if statement is the best approach.    SG2: Order from most restrictive\/selective group to least restrictive  In this example the order does not matter.    SG3: Write if statement with Boolean expression  To determine if the value in currentNumber is odd, we can check the remainder after dividing by 2 (using the modulus operator): if (currentNumber % 2 == 1)    SG4: Follow with true bracket including action  In the true branch, change value of currentNumber to be 4 times its current value and add 1.  if (currentNumber % 2 == 1) { currentNumber = currentNumber * 4 + 1; }    SG5 : Follow with else bracket  In the else branch, change value to half current value. Note that integer division automatically truncates i.e. rounds down.  if (currentNumber % 2 == 1) { currentNumber = currentNumber * 4 + 1; } else { currenNumber \/= 2; }    SG6: Repeat until all groups and actions are accounted for  Not used – only two branches    Equivalent solution using the other ordering of the range\/case groups.  if (currentNumber % 2 == 0) { currentNumber \/= 2; } else { currentNumber = currentNumber * 4 + 1; }   public class main{ public static void main(String args[]){ } }   Practice Pages        "

Problem: Write a loop that will add up 1 + 1\/2 + 1\/4 + 1\/8 + 1\/16 + … + 1\/1024     SG1: Determine purpose of loop  Because we know the number of iterations, we could choose a for-loop, but for this exercise we will go with the general purpose while-loop.    SG2: Define and initialize variables  double sum = 0; double term = 1.0; while ( ) { } System.out.println(sum);    SG3: Define termination condition invert to continuation condition  The denominators are increasing powers of 2. The first denominator, if you think of 1 as 1\/1, is 2 raised to the power of 0. The final denominator, 1024, is 2 raised to the power of 10, so we will iterate from zero to ten. We know we need to iterate 10 times, from the variable i starting a 0 and it should end when i is 11. To convert (i >= 11) to a termination condition, it becomes (i <= 10) so the code is:  double sum = 0; double term = 1.0; int i = 0; while ( i <= 10 ) { } System.out.println(sum);    SG4: Write loop body  double sum = 0; double term = 1.0; int i = 0; while ( i <= 10 ) { sum = sum + term; term = 0.5 * term; \/\/same as divide term in half i++; } System.out.println(sum);  Here is the equivalent for loop approach to solve this problem:  double sum = 0; double term = 1.0; for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) { sum = sum + term; term = 0.5 * term; } System.out.println(sum);    Practice Pages        "

Problem: Write a loop that will prompt the user to continue to enter numbers until a sentinel value of -1 is entered and prints out the maximum value that was entered.    SG1: Determine purpose of loop  Generally, while-loops are a good choice for sentinel loops.    SG2: Define and initialize variables  We will need variables to store the most recent input value, as well as the maximum value so far.  We will also need a Scanner to accept user input, as well as a priming read.  Scanner get = new Scanner(System.in); int value; int maxSoFar; System.out.println(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end\"); value = get.nextInt(); while ( ) { }    SG3: Define termination condition invert to continuation condition  We want to stop reading values when the sentinel value of -1 is read. So the termination condition is: value == -1  >   SG4a: Update condition (LCV) to reach termination  To invert that condition to become a continuation condition looks like:  Scanner get = new Scanner(System.in); int value; int maxSoFar; System.out.println(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end\"); value = get.nextInt(); while ( value != -1 ) { System.out.println(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end\"); value = get.nextInt(); }    SG4: Write loop body  Finding the maximum value is a common algorithm. The basic pieces of the algorithm are:    Initialize a variable to hold the first value    If the next value is larger than the value stored, then store the new value as the maximum    Continue until all values have been processed    In the following code, notice the new variable declaration maxSoFar to hold the maximum value. It is initialized to the sentinel value since we know all valid values entered must be larger than the sentinel value. Inside the loop, we compare the newest value read to the value in maxSoFar and the larger value is stored. Notice the if statement after the loop which accounts for the fact that no valid values may have been entered.  Scanner get = new Scanner(System.in); int value; int maxSoFar = -1; System.out.println(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end\"); value = get.nextInt(); while ( value != -1 ) { if (value > maxSoFar) maxSoFar = value; System.out.println(\"Enter a value, enter -1 to end\"); value = get.nextInt(); } if (maxSoFar > -1) System.out.println(\"The maximum is \" + maxSoFar); else System.out.println(\"No values entered\");    Practice Pages         public class main{ public static void main(String args[]){ } }   "

You can watch this video or read through the content below it.     Problem 1: Write a public method header that accepts as parameters 2 integers and a String in this order and calculates the maximum time of something and returns a double value.   For this Worked Exmaple, we will focus on SG1: Define method header based on problem.     When you pick your method name:      Make it something related to the use of the method.    Recall that method names are never capitalized at the first letter.    We will call this method maxTime         A full method header contains:      access modifier,    return type,    method name, and    full parameter list (data type parameter_name)             public double maxTime (int a, int b, String c) {}   A call to this method would look like:   double x = obj.maxTime(5, 3, \"happy\");    Problem 2: Write a public method that does not return anything but accepts as parameters 3 Strings and prints out a cheerful sentence with the input in it.   Note: The video for this problem is on page 9.4.      When you pick your method name:      Make it something related to the use of the method.    Recall that method names are never capitalized at the first letter.

Repeat as needed, adding parameters   public TimeType (int hr, int min, int sec) { if (hr >=0 && hr <= 23) hour = hr; if (min >= 0 && min <= 59) minute = min; if (sec >= 0 && sec <= 59) second = sec; }     We are now able to construct TimeType objects from the main method in two ways   public static void main (String [] args) { TimeType midnight = new TimeType(); \/\/call the default constructor TimeType noon = new TimeType(12, 0, 0); \/\/call an overloaded constructor }   Update the UML Diagram       Practice Pages           "

Problem: Assume that the integer array alpha has been properly declared and is full of data values. Evaluate these statements and determine the value of avg . If any error occurs, give the reason.   int sum = 0; double avg = 0.0; for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length; i++) sum = sum + alpha[i]; if (alpha.length != 0) avg = (sum * 1.0)  \/ alpha.length;     SG1: Set up array from 0 to size-1        alpha is an array of ints and has values, but we don’t know what those values are    however, we can still diagram a representation of this array    notice that the largest index is size - 1       SG2: Evaluate data type of statements against array  References to the array are in the loop and selection statements:   for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length; i++) sum = sum + alpha[i]; if (alpha.length != 0) avg = (sum * 1.0) \/ alpha.length;      This loop has index i go from 0 to size - 1 (<length) by increments of 1.

All indexes into the array are valid, and all assignments are valid.       SG3: Trace statements, updating slots as you go  Let us trace with a sample array.     First, sum and avg are both initialized to zero values, and then a for-loop is used to traverse the array to calculate the sum. The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and calculations during each iteration of the loop, starting when i has a value of zero.     Next we look at the selection statement:   if (alpha.length != 0) avg = (sum * 1.0) \/ alpha.length;   In our sample, alpha.length is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12, for a final value of 12 in avg .  Why have the selection statement? What if the array has been declared, but has no values? Then its size is 0 – and we would be dividing by 0! An exception! So we guard against this by checking the length.  Why do we need to multiply sum by 1.0? Remember, an int divided by an int is always an int! Our sample did not have any remainder or decimal value, but that might not always be the case. So we need to make sure that either the divisor or dividend is a double; and one way to do this without affecting the value is to multiply it by 1.0. Another way would be to add 0.0 to the value. Still another way would be to cast the value as a double.  The more general answer to the original question is: “ avg contains the average of the values in the array alpha or 0 if alpha is empty.”    Practice Pages        "

Problem: Assume that the integer array alpha has been properly declared and is full of data values, and that the variable target is an int with a value in it. Evaluate these statements and determine the value of loc . If any error occurs, give the reason.   int loc = -1; boolean found = false; for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length && !found; i++) { if (alpha[i] == target) { loc = i; found = true; } }     SG1: Set up array from 0 to size-1        alpha is an array of ints and has values, but we don’t know what those values are    however, we can still diagram a representation of this array    notice that the largest index is size - 1       SG2: Evaluate data type of statements against array  References to the array are in the loop and selection statements:   for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length && !found; i++) { if (alpha[i] == target) { loc = i; found = true; } }      This loop has index i go from 0 to size - 1 (<length) by increments of 1.    Then the value at alpha[i] is compared to the int value of target.    If the value at alpha[i] is equal to target, then the value i is copied into loc.    All indexes into the array are valid, and all assignments are valid.       SG3: Trace statements, updating slots as you go  Let us trace with a sample array and assume the value of target is 15.     The first statement, int loc = -1; gives loc a value that is not a valid index for any array.  Then a for-loop is used to traverse the array and compare each element to target . The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and comparisons during each iteration of the loop, starting when i has a value of zero.     When we find the target value in the array, we store the index (location) of where it is in the array.  Some questions to consider:     What would happen if the target value is not in the array? Then the selection statement is never true, and loc is never changed from its initial value of -1.    Why is -1 a good initial value for loc ? It is not a valid index for any array. You or another programmer using this algorithm could check the value of loc to make a decision (selection!) for how the program will behave when the target value is found or not found at a valid array index.    What would happen if there were 2 occurrences of the target value in the array? The loop does not end when the target value is found, so additional occurences would overwrite the value of loc with the last occurence.     The more general answer to the original question is: “ loc contains the index of the last occurrence of target in the array alpha or -1 if target is not in the array.”    Practice Pages        "

Problem: Write the code to “reverse” the elements of an array.  There are several different approaches you might take. We will examine two options here.    Solution 1 – copy to new array with reverse traverse  We will begin with a sample array called original , and another array of the same size called copy .  int [] original = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; int [] copy = new int [original.length];  Then we loop in reverse for the original array, copying the elements in order and placing them starting at the beginning of the new array. The variable place helps us with traversing the new array in the opposite direction of our reversed traversal of the original.  int place = 0; for (int i = original.length - 1; i >= 0; i++) copy[place++] = original[i];    Solution 2 – same array with swaps  In this solution, we do not need the whole extra array in memory. The loop only traverses half of the array, swapping the value at i with the value at the mirrored\/reflected position array.length - i - 1 .  for (int i=0; i<array.length\/2; i++) { int temp = array[i]; array[i] = array[array.length - i - 1]; array[array.length - i - 1] = temp; }    Practice Pages        "
