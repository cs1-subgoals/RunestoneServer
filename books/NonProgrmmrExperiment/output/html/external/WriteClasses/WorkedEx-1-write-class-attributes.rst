Worked Example: Writing Classes - Attributes
==================================================

.. topic:: Subgoals for Writing a Class 1/4

   1. Name it 


   2. Differentiate class-level (static) vs. instance/object-level variables  


   3. Differentiate class-level (static) vs. instance/object behaviors/methods 
   

   4. Define class variables (static) as needed '
   
      A. Name 
      B. Data Type 
      C. public / private / final 
      
      
   5. Define instance variables (that you want to be interrelated)  

      A. Name 
      B. Data Type 
      C. private

Problem: We will be writing a class to represent an instance of time, like a specific time in the day.

For the first part, determine the appropriate attributes (data) to be stored and declare them

   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. topic:: SG1: Name it 

   We will call the class TimeType
   

.. topic:: SG2: Differentiate class-level (static) vs. instance/object-level variables  

   class-level (static) data:  one value shared between ALL instances
   instance-level data: each instance has its own copy

   For time, we want all time instances to be in the same format so 
   static data for format, everything else instance
   

.. topic:: SG3: Differentiate class-level (static) vs. instance/object behaviors/methods 

   All methods will be instance level as the format will be fixed an unchangeable


.. topic:: SG4: Define class variables (static) as needed 

   .. code-block:: java
  
      public class TimeType {
      
         public static final boolean FORMAT24 = true;

      }Â 
      
   Note the use of the ``final`` keyword to define ``FORMAT24`` as a constant, which makes it safe to expose as ``public``. An alternate implementation might choose to make this value mutable, but private, using static methods to ssssssssaccess and alter it.


.. topic:: SG5: Define instance variables (that you want to be interrelated) 
   
   .. code-block:: java
   
      public class TimeType {
      
         //static var
         public static final boolean FORMAT24 = true;
         
         //instance vars
         private int hour;
         private int minute;
         private int second;

      }
