Worked Example: Create Instance of Scanner
==============================================

.. topic:: Subgoals for using objects (creating instances)

   1. Declare variable of appropriate class datatype.
    
   2. Assign to variable: keyword new, followed by class name, followed by ().
    
   3. Determine whether parameter(s) are appropriate (API)
    
      a. Number of parameters
        
      b. Data types of the parameters

.. topic:: SG1: Declare variable of appropriate class datatype.

   In the code block below, the variable name ``sysinScanner`` was selected to better describe what we are going to do with this Scanner, which will become more clear in SG3.
    
   .. code-block:: java
    
      Scanner sysinScanner;
      
.. topic:: SG2: Assign to variable: Â keyword new, followed by class name, followed by ().
    
    .. code-block:: java
    
      sysinScanner = new Scanner();
        
.. topic:: SG3: Determine whether parameter(s) are appropriate (API)

   The figure below shows the Java documentation, so we can determine what parameter(s) we need. Most of the ways to construct a Scanner require exactly 1 parameter, an object that represents the source of input data. We'll use the standard system input from the console ``System.in``.
