   2. Evaluate data type of statements against array

Problem: Assume that the integer array ``alpha`` has been properly declared and is full of data values. Evaluate these statements and determine the value of ``min``. If any error occurs, give the reason.

.. code-block:: java
   
   int min = alpha[0];
   for (int i = 1; i < alpha.length; i++) {
       if (alpha[i] < min)
           min = alpha[i];
   }

   - alpha is an array of ints and has values, but we donâ€™t know what those values are
   - however, we can still diagram a representation of this array
   - notice that the largest index is size - 1

   
.. topic:: SG2: Evaluate data type of statements against array

   The first statement, ``int min = alpha[0]``, is valid because ``alpha`` stores integers, and 0 is a valid index. You can assign an int value to an int variable such as ``min``.

   .. code-block:: java
 
      for (int i = 1; i < alpha.length; i++) {
         if (alpha[i] < min)
            min = alpha[i];
      }

   - This loop has index i go from 0 to size - 1 (<length) by increments of 1.
   - Then the value at alpha[i] is compared to min.  If the value at alpha[i] is less than min, then alpha[i] is copied into min.  
   - All indexes into the array are valid, and all assignments are valid.

.. topic:: SG3: Trace statements, updating slots as you go

   Let us trace with a sample array.
   
   .. figure:: Figures/we4-sample.png
      :alt: Sample Array
      :scale: 50%  

   The first line of the code sample initializes ``min`` to copy the value from ``alpha[0]``, which in our sample is 12, and then a for-loop is used to traverse the array. The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and calculations during each iteration of the loop, starting when i has a value of zero.
   
   .. figure:: Figures/we5-trace.png
      :alt: Trace the loop
      :scale: 50%  
      
   We can see that each time a smaller value is located in the array, that value is stored in  ``min``.
   
   The more general answer to the original question is: "``min`` contains the smallest value found in the array ``alpha``."
