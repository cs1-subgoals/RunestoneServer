Problem: Assume that the integer array ``alpha`` has been properly declared and is full of data values, and that the variable ``target`` is an int with a value in it. Evaluate these statements and determine the value of ``loc``. If any error occurs, give the reason.

.. code-block:: java
   
   int loc = -1;
   boolean found = false;
   for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length && !found; i++) {
      if (alpha[i] == target) 	{
         loc = i;  found = true;  
   }

   - alpha is an array of ints and has values, but we donâ€™t know what those values are
   - however, we can still diagram a representation of this array
   - notice that the largest index is size - 1

   
.. topic:: SG2: Evaluate data type of statements against array

   References to the array are in the loop and selection statements:

   .. code-block:: java
 
      for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length && !found; i++) {
         if (alpha[i] == target) 	{
            loc = i;  found = true;  
      }

   - This loop has index i go from 0 to size - 1 (<length) by increments of 1.
   - Then the value at alpha[i] is compared to the int value of target.  
   - If the value at alpha[i] is equal to target, then the value i is copied into loc.
   - All indexes into the array are valid, and all assignments are valid.

.. topic:: SG3: Trace statements, updating slots as you go

   Let us trace with a sample array and assume the value of ``target`` is 15.
   
   .. figure:: Figures/we4-sample.png
      :alt: Sample Array
      :scale: 50%  

   The first statement, ``int loc = -1;`` gives ``loc`` a value that is not a valid index for any array.
   
   Then a for-loop is used to traverse the array and compare each element to ``target``. The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and comparisons during each iteration of the loop, starting when i has a value of zero.
   
   .. figure:: Figures/we7-trace.png
      :alt: Trace searching for target
      
   When we find the target value in the array, we store the index (location) of where it is in the array. 

   Some questions to consider:
   
   1. What would happen if the ``target`` value is not in the array? Then the selection statement is never true, and ``loc`` is never changed from its initial value of -1. 
   
   2. Why is -1 a good initial value for ``loc``? It is not a valid index for any array. You or another programmer using this algorithm could check the value of  ``loc`` to make a decision (selection!) for how the program will behave when the ``target`` value is found or not found at a valid array index.
   
   3. What would happen if there were 2 occurrences of the target value in the array? The loop does not end when the ``target`` value is found, so additional occurences would overwrite the value of ``loc`` with the **last** occurence.
   
   The more general answer to the original question is: "``loc`` contains the index of the last occurrence of ``target`` in the array ``alpha`` or -1 if ``target`` is not in the array."
