<div class="para" id="p-1217">Jamal is on a strict diet and needs to know whether or not he can eat a salad from the local fast food company. If Jamal’s total caloric intake for the day should be no more than 3600 calories and he wants to split up the calories evenly across 3 meals, indicate if the salad is a good choice by storing the result in a variable named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">allowableMeal</code>. The plain salad that he wants to eat is 800 calories. He wants to add cheese (200 calories) and bacon bits (300 calories) and really wants 2 ranch dressing packs (each pack is 150 calories).</div>
<li data-component="answer" id="_opt_a"><div class="para" id="p-1218"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int allowableMeal = (800 + 200 + 300 + 2 * 150) &lt;= (3600 / 3);</code></div></li>
<li data-component="feedback" id="_opt_a"><div class="para" id="p-1219">Incorrect. We want a yes/no answer as to whether Jamal should eat the meal, so the result variable is a boolean. The total calories in the salad is all the pieces added up (800 plus 200 plus 300 plus 2 packets of ranch). We need to compare this to the total number of calories per day divided by 3 and see if it’s less than or equal to that amount. Here we divide by 3.0 to ensure that we’ll do double arithmetic, though in this case it is unnecessary.</div></li>
