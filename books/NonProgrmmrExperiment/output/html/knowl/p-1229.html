If the package must arrive within a specified number of days, there is an additional charge based on the number of days. If it is an overnight shipment, add $49.95. For each additional day that it takes for delivery you can subtract $4.25. Store the total cost in a variable named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cost</code>.</div>
