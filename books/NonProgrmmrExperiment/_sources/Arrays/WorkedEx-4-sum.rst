   1. Set up array from 0 to size-1 


   2. Evaluate data type of statements against array


   3. Trace statements, updating slots as you go

Problem: Assume that the integer array ``alpha`` has been properly declared and is full of data values. Evaluate these statements and determine the value of ``sum``. If any error occurs, give the reason.

.. code-block:: java
   
   int sum = 0;

   for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length; i++) {
      sum += alpha[i];
   }

   - alpha is an array of ints and has values, but we donâ€™t know what those values are
   - however, we can still diagram a representation of this array
   - notice that the largest index is size - 1

   
.. topic:: SG2: Evaluate data type of statements against array

   .. code-block:: java
 
      for (int i = 0; i < alpha.length; i++) {
         sum += alpha[i];
      }

   - This loop has index i go from 0 to size - 1 (<length) by increments of 1.
   - Then the value at alpha[i] is added to sum.  
   - All indexes into the array are valid, and all assignments are valid.

.. topic:: SG3: Trace statements, updating slots as you go

   Let us trace with a sample array.
   
   .. figure:: Figures/we4-sample.png
      :alt: Sample Array
      :scale: 50%  

   The first line of the code sample initializes ``sum`` to a have a value of zero, and then a for-loop is used to traverse the array. The chart below uses one line to represent the memory and calculations during each iteration of the loop, starting when i has a value of zero.

      :alt: Trace the loop
      
   The final value of ``sum`` is 59, which s the sum of all values in the array.
   
   The more general answer to the original question is: "``sum`` contains the sum of all the values in the array ``alpha``."
