<h4>Updates September 16, 2022</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Updated course creation page.  Note more fields are now required.  But we provide a suggested course name which should help keep things more tidy and easy to organize.  We've also rebuilt everything behind the scenes to make it easier to add new courses to this page.</li>
    <li>Reimplemented Library page. You will not notice much difference but it is all new under the hood! Please check the library to see the many new books we have added!</li>
    <li>ActiveCodes will now Load the history automatically!  Something everyone has wanted for a long time.</li>
    <li>
        Some books will have a new look!  We are gradually migrating to PreTeXt as our primary authoring language.  See <a href="/ns/books/published/httlacs/frontmatter-1.html?mode=browsing">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: PreTeXt Interactive Edition</a> To see what the future looks like.  If you have a student that needs a paper copy or even braille contact us.  Although they will not be interactive. :-) Of course we welcome feedback on this new style.
    </li>
    <li>I have updated the <a href="/ns/books/published/instructorguide/frontmatter-1.html?mode=browsing">Instructor Guide</a>! If the guide does not answer your question please let me know so I can improve it.
    <li>
        Peer Instruction!  Peer instruction is ready for more use.  Here is a link to a <a href="https://youtu.be/bP75MZYe2uU">virtual workshop</a> on how you can use Peer instruction with Runestone.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read
    <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html"
        >This letter</a
    >Please note, cyber insurance has become prohibitively expensive. Basically we can pay our server bill or we can buy insurance.  You would probably rather have us pay our server bill, so anything you can do to convince your district to support Runestone will help me to do both.  Runestone Academy is incorporated as a non-profit, we are awaiting approval of our 501(c)(3) status.

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 60,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the
    August 2021/22 school year.  At $100 a textbook we saved students $6 million last year! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time.  Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and could add support staff.

<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
