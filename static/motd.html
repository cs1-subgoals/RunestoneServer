<h4>Summer Updates (August 7, 2022)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some books will have a new look!  We are gradually migrating to PreTeXt as our primary authoring language.  See <a href="/ns/books/published/httlacs/frontmatter-1.html?mode=browsing">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: PreTeXt Interactive Edition</a> To see what the future looks like.  If you have a student that needs a paper copy or even braille contact us.  Although they will not be interactive. :-) Of course we welcome feedback on this new style.
    </li>
    <li>
        Peer Instruction!  Peer instruction is ready for more use.  Here is a link to a <a href="https://youtu.be/bP75MZYe2uU">virtual workshop</a> on how you can use Peer instruction with Runestone.
    </li>
    <li>New look for most exercises.  We have modernized the look and feel a bit.  Hope you like it.</li>

<h4>High School Teachers:</h4>
<p>
    We want you to use Runestone! But before your school district sends me a contract to
    sign, please read
    <a href="https://blog.runestone.academy/2021/05/28/data_privacy_agreements.html"
        >This letter</a
    >  Please note, I am working on getting insurance so that I can sign more of these DPAs! But cyber insurance is expensive! Anything you can do to convince your district to support Runestone will help me to do this.  Runestone Academy is incorporated as a non-profit, we are awaiting approval of our 501(c)(3) status.
</p>
<p>
    If you are curious about Runestone's finances, I am as transparent as possible.
    please see

<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 60,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the
    August 2021/22 school year.  At $100 a textbook we saved students $6 million last year! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time.  Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and could add support staff.
    
</p>
<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
